Hey there, Yang Hong here. Today is December 9th, 2025, hoping you stay in good.

Farming is a business of risk. You worry about the weather. You worry about the bugs. You worry about the price of diesel. But in 2025, the biggest risk to the American farmer isn't a drought or a flood. It’s the trade policy coming out of the White House.

President Trump just announced a $12 billion aid package for farmers. He calls it "relief." But if you look at where that money comes from—and why it’s needed—it looks less like relief and more like a Money Circle that goes nowhere.

So, let's trace the money. It’s a fascinating, if painful, loop.

Step 1: The US puts tariffs on China. We tax their goods. 
Step 2: China retaliates. They stop buying American soybeans. 
Step 3: American farmers lose billions because their biggest customer just walked away. 
Step 4: The US government takes the tariff money collected in Step 1 and writes a check to the farmer in Step 3.

We are effectively breaking the farmer's legs with one hand (i mean trade policy) and handing him a crutch with the bailout. The administration says this buys "certainty." But for a business that relies on decades-long relationships with buyers, a one-time government check isn't certainty. It’s a band-aid on a gunshot wound.

$12 billion. That’s a huge number. That is roughly the value of the entire soybean harvest of Illinois and Iowa combined. We are essentially buying a huge chunk of the nation's crop with tax dollars because nobody else will buy it.

This money is absolutely necessary for the farmers right now. Without it, thousands of family farms would likely go bankrupt this winter. It stops the immediate bleeding. But we are substituting "Trade" (selling goods to a market) for "Welfare" (living on a government check).

And there is a twist that makes this even more painful. While US farmers were stuck with silos full of unsold beans, the US recently helped bail out Argentina with $20 billion. What did Argentina do? They had a bumper crop and sold their soybeans to China. So, American tax dollars effectively subsidized a competitor who stepped in to steal the American farmer's customer. The math suggests we aren't just losing money; we are actively funding our own competition.

It isn't that farmers go broke today. The check clears. They are fine for 2025. The risk is the Permanent Subsidy.

Markets are like habits. Once China gets used to buying from Brazil and Argentina, they build new ports, new contracts, and new relationships. Even if the trade war ends tomorrow, those customers might not come back.

The Trade-off is structural. We are risking turning the American agriculture sector into a permanent ward of the state. We are moving from "Feeding the World" to "Being Fed by the Treasury." And history tells us that once an industry gets hooked on bailouts, it is incredibly hard to get them off.
