Hey there, Yang Hong here. Today is December 9th, hoping you stay in good.

Let's talk about how you fire a government agency. Usually, to shut down a federal department, you need an Act of Congress. It takes years. It is incredibly messy. But the Trump administration just found a loophole. 
You don't fire the agency; you just take away all its work.

They are implementing a plan to strip the Department of Education of its power, not by passing a law, but by outsourcing its job to other buildings. It sounds like a boring bureaucratic shuffle. But if you look at where the power is going, it tells you exactly what the American economy is terrified of.

So, follow the money. The Department of Education manages tens of billions of dollars. Under this new plan, the biggest chunk of that responsibility—oversight of K-12 schools and funding for low-income districts—is moving to the Department of Labor.

Why Labor? That is the tell. This isn't just about saving money or "state's rights." This is about Demographics. The Baby Boomers are retiring. They are leaving the workforce in massive waves. We are entering a period of chronic labor shortages. We are short hundreds of thousands of skilled workers right now. By moving schools under the Department of Labor, the administration is signaling a fundamental shift: Schools are no longer just places for learning. They are now factories for workers.

The reports say this move affects roughly $31 billion in education spending. Imagine you run a bakery. For twenty years, you paid a "Head Chef" to teach your apprentices how to bake beautiful, artistic cakes. But now, you are running out of staff. You can't fill orders. So, you fire the Chef and you hire a Factory Foreman. The Foreman doesn't care about the art of the cake. He cares about how many loaves of bread you can get out the door per hour.

Now, Obviously, students aren't loaves of bread, and teachers aren't assembly line robots. This transition will be slow and legally complicated. But the structural incentive is changing. We are substituting "Education for Citizenship"—learning history, art, critical thinking—for "Training for Employment."

The Department of Labor doesn't measure success by how well-rounded a student is. They measure success by Job Placement. They want to turn high schools into trade school pipelines because the economy is screaming for welders, not philosophers.

i most worry is the Liberal Arts model of public education dies. The risk is that we solve the labor shortage today, but we break the innovation pipeline for tomorrow.

The Trade-off is subtle. If we train every kid to be a worker bee because we need labor now, we might stop producing the inventors and the thinkers who create the next economy. We are prioritizing "Efficiency" over "Creativity." That solves the inflation problem in the 2020s. But it might create a stagnation problem in the 2040s. We are fixing the leak in the roof by pulling wood out of the foundation.
