Hey there, Yang Hong here. Today is December 12th, hoping you stay in good.

"We keep it, I guess."

That is what the President of the United States said yesterday. He wasn’t talking about a Christmas gift. He was talking about a supertanker—the Skipper—loaded with 2 million barrels of crude oil that the US Navy and Coast Guard just seized in international waters.

At the exact same time, on the East Coast, the federal government is tearing up permits for wind farms that are already under construction.

These look like two different stories. One is foreign policy; the other is climate policy. But they aren't. They are the exact same story. This isn't about "Green" vs. "Dirty." This is about "Expensive" vs. "Free."

The Structural Context We need to look at this through the lens of Inflation Realism.

For the last three years, the biggest political enemy in America has been the grocery bill. It has been the electricity bill. The American voter screams about prices, and the new administration has heard that scream.

They have looked at the energy board and decided that "Future Planning" are luxury goods that we can no longer afford. They are stripping the system down to raw math. And the math says: Building new things costs money. Taking existing things makes money.

Offshore wind is an investment. It is heavy infrastructure. You have to build the turbines, lay the cables, and crucially, you have to subsidize the tax credits to get it started.

In the long run, wind gives you energy independence. But in the short run? It costs tax dollars. It often raises utility rates while the grid adjusts. It requires capital expenditure (CAPEX).

Trump looks at a wind farm and he doesn't see "Clean Energy." He sees a line item on a budget sheet. He sees a subsidy. He sees a cost that he can cut to make his balance sheet look better today. So, he kills it. He halted the Empire Wind project. He’s risking lawsuits from Orsted and Equinor. He is willing to let billions of dollars in sunk costs evaporate.

Because in his view, that is "Inflationary Spending." He calls it a "scam," but what he really means is "it’s too expensive right now."

AT THE SAME TIME

The US Coast Guard just boarded a Venezuelan tanker. They took control of the ship. They are bringing the oil to a US port. And—according to the White House—they are going to sell it.

This is the exact opposite of the wind farm. The wind farm costs money to build. The seized oil? That is free revenue. It costs zero dollars to produce that oil—because Venezuela already produced it. We just took it.

The administration calls this "Counter-Terrorism" or "Sanctions Enforcement." And technically, under US law, they can do that. But economically? This is a cash grab. It’s a supply injection. It puts oil onto the market without the US drilling a single hole.

Imagine you have a leaky roof (that’s the US energy grid). You have two choices.

You hire a contractor, buy high-quality solar tiles, and pay $50,000 to fix it properly for the next 30 years. It hurts your wallet today, but your house is secure.

You can also wait until your neighbor leaves for work, you climb over the fence, and you steal his tarp. Then you nail it to your roof.

The Wind Farm. It’s responsible, it’s structural, but your bank account takes a hit today. Tanker Seizure. It’s aggressive, it’s messy, but it costs you nothing right now. In fact, if you steal two tarps, you can sell one on eBay.

Obviously, stealing your neighbor’s tarp doesn’t fix the roof forever. And seizing one tanker doesn’t solve the national deficit. We aren't going to power the whole US economy on seized Venezuelan crude. But it looks like the US is moving from "Investing in Production" to "Aggressive Acquisition."

The market actually loves this right now. Oil prices barely moved—Brent Crude only rose 27 cents—because traders see "free supply" coming in. The stock market doesn't care about the wind farm lawsuits yet. They just see lower spending.

But When you kill the wind industry, you aren't just killing a few projects. You are killing the supply chain. The specialized ships, the cable factories, the steel workers—they are all packing up and moving to Europe or Asia. Siemens Energy is already saying the US market "does not exist."

If we enter a world where we rely on seizing assets to keep prices down, instead of building infrastructure to keep the lights on, we become incredibly fragile.

We are eating our seed corn. We are burning the furniture to heat the house because we don't want to pay for the furnace. It feels warm right now. But eventually, you run out of furniture.

See you next time.
